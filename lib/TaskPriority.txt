Air India wants to keep its business-class passengers engaged while waiting in the airport due to unexpected 
delays in scheduled flights.
A bar-code behind business-class tickets can be scanned to gain access to an app that shall help passengers 
initiate a chat with co-passengers in their vicinity. 

- Each passenger in the app would have a short bio (Name, Designation, Company).
- An individual can initiate a request to connect with a co-passenger, after being accepted, they can continue 
to chat, or block the user

You can assume that user details to be present in the database.
Just focus on implementing the passenger list and chat screens.
Please find attached the design screen for reference.

Mention your choices for the following while developing the app:
- State management library.
- Cloud service for storage.

on first before anyother one
